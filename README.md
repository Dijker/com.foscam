# Foscam IPCamera for Homey

This app will add support for the IP camera's made by [Foscam](https://www.foscam.com "Foscam - Home Security").

> Virtually every camera is supported because all devices use one generic API, but exceptions can occur. Please let me know if this is the case.

## Supported devices
This app should support all types of devices below. I do not know about the Baby Monitor and Battery Camera. Please let me know!

- [PT Camera](https://foscam.com/products/PT_Camera.html)
- [PTZ Camera](https://foscam.com/products/PTZ_Camera.html)
